# FOP_project
This project aims to create Python-to-Java interpreter, which supports minimal subset of Python, with an empahsis on basic constructs like variables, arithmetic, conditionals, and iterative control flow. The interpreter will be capable of executing following algorithms:

1. Sum of First N Numbers
2. Factorial of N
3. GCD of Two Numbers
4. Reverse a Number
5. Check if a Number is Prime
6. Check if a Number is Palindrome
7. Find the Largest Digit in a Number
8. Sum of Digits
9. Multiplication Table
10. Nth Fibonacci Number
